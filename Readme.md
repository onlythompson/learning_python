# Fundamentals of Programming in Python

## The Concept of Syntax and Semantics
- Okon is a Boy
- Okon is 12 Years Old -> Information
- Deduce these Types
- Okon = String
- 12 = Number
- All = String
- O = Char


### Type => Data Types
Anything you imagine. 
### Specific Data Types in Python
- Alphanumeric : str - (String) (high Level)
- Numbers : Interger (int), Float (float) and Complex Number (complex)
- Sequence  : String, List, Tuples
- Dictionary
- Boolean
- Set

### Comments
- Single Comments :  # single comment
- Multiline Comments :  """ Multiline Comments """


## Concept of Variables
A variable is a temporary location in memory to store data.
Syntax : `variable-name = value`
e.g `name = "Joseph"` #This mean create a location in memory call name and store value Joseph in that location.

#### To do create the following variable
- Create a varibale called firstname  with no value
- Create a variable called surname with no value
- Create a variable called  gender with a string value = "Male"
- Assign the value 'Thompson' to the surname variable
- Assign the value of 'Dominic' to the firsname variable.
- Call the variable firstname and print on the console.
- Call the variable surname and print on the console.
- Call the variable gender and print on the console.

- Change the value of firstname to your name.
- Create a variable called  fullname and assign the firstname and surname to it.

### Concept of Functions (Method, Subroutine, Procedure) I

Function is a wrapper around a group of statements.
The fundamental things we do with functions are:
- Define Function -> Creating function that does a specific task.
    To define a function in python, we start by using the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function, a set of parenthesis and a colon.
- Calling a Function -> Using a defined function.
